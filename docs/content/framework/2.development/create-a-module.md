title: How to Create a Module
description: A module is a self-contained unit of design and code that encapsulates a specific design pattern or functionality. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to create a new module for our design system.

## Step 1: Define the module's purpose and scope

Before creating a new module, it's important to define its purpose and scope. What problem is the module solving? What design pattern or functionality does it encapsulate? What use cases will it support? Defining these parameters upfront will help ensure that the module is well-designed and useful for our users.

## Step 2: Design the module's visual and functional components

Once the module's purpose and scope are defined, it's time to design its visual and functional components. This typically involves creating wireframes or sketches of the module's interface, defining its layout and visual design, and determining its functional behavior.

## Step 3: Create the module's markup

After the module's design is finalized, it's time to create the module's markup. This involves writing the HTML or other markup language that defines the structure and content of the module. The markup should be clean, semantic, and reusable.

## Step 4: Style the module

Once the markup is complete, it's time to style the module. This involves writing the CSS or other styles that define the module's visual design. The styles should be modular, reusable, and consistent with the design system's overall visual language.

## Step 5: Define the module's JavaScript behavior

After the markup and styles are complete, it's time to define the module's JavaScript behavior. This involves writing the JavaScript code that enables the module's functional behavior, such as user interaction, data handling, or animation. The JavaScript should be modular, reusable, and follow best practices for performance and accessibility.

## Step 6: Package the module

Once the module's markup, styles, and JavaScript are complete, it's time to package the module as a self-contained unit. This typically involves organizing the
