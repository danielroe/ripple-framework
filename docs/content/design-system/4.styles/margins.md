## Usage

In our design system, margins should be used consistently throughout all components and layouts. We use a standardized set of margin values to ensure a consistent look and feel across our design system.

### Margin Values

Our standard margin values are:

- `0` - no margin
- `4px` - small margin
- `8px` - medium margin
- `16px` - large margin
- `32px` - extra large margin

These values should be used for both horizontal and vertical margins, and can be combined to create more complex margin patterns.

### Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use margins in our design system:

- Use a small margin between text and icons.
- Use a medium margin between buttons and form elements.
- Use a large margin between sections of a page.
- Use an extra large margin between the header and main content of a page.

## Implementation

Margins can be implemented in CSS using the `margin` property. Here's an example:

```css
.my-element {
  margin: 16px;
}
```

Margins can also be applied to specific sides of an element using the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties:

### Best Practices

To ensure consistency and maintainability, we recommend the following best practices when using margins in our design system:

- Use the standard margin values whenever possible.
- Use margins consistently throughout all components and layouts.
- Avoid using non-standard margin values or creating custom margin patterns.
- Use margin sparingly to avoid cluttering designs with too much whitespace.
