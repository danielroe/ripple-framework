## How it Works

A card typically consists of a container with a header, body, and footer. The header often contains a title or an image, while the body contains the main content. The footer may contain additional information or actions, such as buttons or links.

Cards can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Displaying blog posts or news articles.
- Displaying products or services in an e-commerce store.
- Displaying user profiles or contacts in a social media app.

## Best Practices

When using a card, it's important to follow some best practices to ensure that it is effective and user-friendly. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

- Use clear and concise headers that accurately reflect the content of the card.
- Use high-quality images that are relevant to the content.
- Use typography that is easy to read and complements the overall design.
- Use whitespace to create a visual hierarchy and make the content more scannable.
- Use responsive design to ensure that the card works well on all devices, including mobile.
