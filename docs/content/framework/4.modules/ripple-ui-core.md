## Benefits of Using the Core UI Module

Using the Core UI Module can provide a number of benefits for designers and developers, including:

- Consistency: By using consistent design elements across all user interfaces, brands can create a more cohesive user experience for visitors.
- Efficiency: By using pre-built UI elements, designers and developers can create user interfaces more quickly and efficiently.
- Scalability: The Core UI Module can be easily extended and modified as new UI elements are needed.

## Examples of Core UI Module Elements

Here are a few examples of UI elements that could be included in the Core UI Module:

### Buttons

The button is one of the most basic and commonly used UI elements. A good button design can make it easy for users to take action on a page. The Core UI Module could include a range of button styles, sizes, and colors.

### Forms

Forms are used to capture user input and can include a range of input types such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns. The Core UI Module could include pre-built form components with consistent styling and layout.

### Typography

Typography is an important aspect of UI design and can greatly impact the look and feel of a user interface. The Core UI Module could include a set of consistent font sizes, weights, and styles.

### Icons

Icons are used to visually represent concepts and can be used to make a user interface more visually engaging and easy to understand. The Core UI Module could include a set of commonly used icons that are consistently designed and styled.

### Colors

Consistent color usage is important for creating a cohesive user experience. The Core UI Module could include a set of predefined color palettes and guidelines for using color in a user interface.
