The Ripple Design System is the front-end layer of SDP. It provides a single source of truth for styles, components and patterns when creating digital experiences on SDP.

This Design System is set up to reduce the design and development time for websites using the Ripple frontend framework.

## What is Single Digital Presence?

Single Digital Presence (SDP) exists to make government information easier for Victorians to find, understand and use.

We do this by fostering a community of digital practitioners, providing them with a purpose-built digital publishing platform, and bringing their work together through a single public website.
